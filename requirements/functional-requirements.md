# Calculator Application - Functional Requirements

## Overview

A command-line calculator application written in ARM64 assembly language for macOS that performs basic addition of two user-provided numbers.

## Target Platform

- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro 16-inch (November 2024)
- **Processor**: Apple M4 Max (ARM64 architecture)
- **Operating System**: macOS
- **Execution Environment**: Terminal applications

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: User Input Collection

- The application SHALL prompt the user to enter the first number
- The application SHALL accept the first integer input from the user via standard input (terminated by ENTER key)
- The application SHALL prompt the user to enter the second number
- The application SHALL accept the second integer input from the user via standard input (terminated by ENTER key)
- The application SHALL handle positive and negative integers
- The application SHALL validate that inputs are valid integers
- The application SHALL display "Enter first number: " as the first input prompt
- The application SHALL display "Enter second number: " as the second input prompt

### FR-002: Mathematical Operation

- The application SHALL calculate the sum of the two provided numbers (a + b = c)
- The application SHALL handle integer overflow appropriately
- The application SHALL produce mathematically correct results within the bounds of 64-bit signed integers

### FR-003: Output Display

- The application SHALL display the result in the format: "a + b = c"
- Where 'a' is the first number, 'b' is the second number, and 'c' is the calculated sum
- The application SHALL output the result to standard output
- The application SHALL include a newline character after the result

### FR-004: User Experience

- The application SHALL provide clear prompts for user input
- Prompts SHALL be in English
- The application SHALL display "Enter first number: " for the first input
- The application SHALL display "Enter second number: " for the second input
- Each number SHALL be entered on a separate line (separated by ENTER key)
- The application SHALL handle user input gracefully

### FR-005: Program Execution

- The application SHALL execute as a standalone binary
- The application SHALL exit with status code 0 upon successful completion
- The application SHALL exit with appropriate non-zero status codes for error conditions
- The application SHALL complete execution after displaying the result

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance

- The application SHALL complete execution within 1 second under normal conditions
- Input processing SHALL be responsive to user typing

### NFR-002: Reliability

- The application SHALL handle invalid input gracefully
- The application SHALL not crash under normal operating conditions
- The application SHALL validate all user inputs before processing

### NFR-003: Maintainability

- The source code SHALL be well-commented
- The code SHALL follow ARM64 assembly best practices
- The code SHALL be structured with clear function boundaries

### NFR-004: Compatibility

- The application SHALL compile and run on macOS with Apple Silicon M4 Max
- The application SHALL use standard macOS system calls
- The application SHALL be compatible with the default macOS terminal

## Input Specifications

### Valid Inputs

- Signed 64-bit integers (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
- Leading whitespace SHALL be ignored
- Trailing newlines SHALL be handled appropriately

### Invalid Inputs

- Non-numeric characters (except for leading minus sign)
- Empty input
- Input exceeding 64-bit integer range
- Multiple numbers on a single line

## Output Specifications

### Success Case

```text
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
5 + 3 = 8
```

### Edge Cases

```text
Enter first number: -10
Enter second number: 7
-10 + 7 = -3
```

```text
Enter first number: 0
Enter second number: 0
0 + 0 = 0
```

## Error Handling

### EH-001: Invalid Input

- The application SHALL display an appropriate error message for invalid inputs
- The application SHALL exit with status code 1 for input validation errors

### EH-002: System Errors

- The application SHALL handle system call failures appropriately
- The application SHALL exit with status code 2 for system-level errors

### EH-003: Overflow Conditions

- The application SHALL detect integer overflow conditions
- The application SHALL display an appropriate error message for overflow
- The application SHALL exit with status code 3 for overflow errors

## Testing Requirements

### TR-001: Unit Testing

- All mathematical operations SHALL be tested with various input combinations
- Edge cases (zero, negative numbers, large numbers) SHALL be tested
- Invalid input handling SHALL be tested

### TR-002: Integration Testing

- End-to-end functionality SHALL be tested
- Input/output behavior SHALL be verified
- Error conditions SHALL be tested

### TR-003: Performance Testing

- Execution time SHALL be measured and verified to meet performance requirements
- Memory usage SHALL be monitored during testing

## Compliance and Standards

### CS-001: Assembly Standards

- Code SHALL follow ARM64 AArch64 instruction set standards
- Code SHALL comply with AAPCS64 calling conventions
- Code SHALL use appropriate macOS system call interfaces

### CS-002: Code Quality

- Code SHALL include comprehensive comments
- Code SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
- Code SHALL be properly formatted and structured
